# BIKE SHARING Assignment
Objective of this project is to understand which factors affect the demand of bikes and how well do these variables describe the demand.


## General Information
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.



## Conclusions
Recommendations for the company:

Demand will be higher in the months numbered 9, 10, 8,7,5 and the demand will be lowest when weather is light rainlight snow thunderstorm, when the season is spring or winter , when its a holiday or a sunday and weather is misty cold.

And the top 3 features contributing to the demand are –

which month is it ? (e.g. demand highest in month 9)
how’s the weather and which season is it? (e.g. demand lowest in winter and spring or when its cold and misty and when there’s thunderstorm)
if it’s a holiday. (e.g. on Sundays demand is low)
